        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Ishaan Bharadwaj, a Class 4 student. I love karate, playing with my friends, and watching Minecraft videos. Recently, I learned how to ride a bicycle, and it is so much fun! I also love spending time with Praharshakka. She is always kind, lovable, and makes every moment fun when we play together.</p>
            <p>I have a cute little sister named Hitanshi, but I call her Chitti Nani with love. She is only 1 year old and is the most adorable person in our family!She has the cutest laugh that makes everyone happy, and I love making her smile by playing peek-a-boo. Her first birthday was so exciting. I had so much fun celebrating with my family and friends.</p>
            <p>My mom and dad are the best parents ever. They give me lots of freedom, which makes me feel special and responsible. My mom is caring and always supports me in whatever I do, and my dad is really cool and always makes time to talk to me and teach me new things.</p>
            <p>Life with my family is filled with love, fun, and happy memories, and I am so grateful for all the adventures we have together!</p>
